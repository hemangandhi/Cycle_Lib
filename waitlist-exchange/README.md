# Cycle-lib

Find cycles in a graph!

## What?

This emulates exchanges for bartering trading circles. This library hopes to find such trading cycles which are modelled as cycles in a graph.

An exchange is a user's (or trader's) statement that they have an object and for it are willing to give up another object.

Exchanges are connected where only viable trades are maintained in the graph.

Trades can have 3 states:
* Found: where the trade has been found.
* Locked: where all members of the trade have committed to the trade and cannot partake in other trades.
* Deleted: where all exchanges are seen as "done" and removed from the graph

## As a REST API...

Any N/A would 404. An exchange is a node. A trade is a cycle.
